		- pgmOperations - contains the functions needed by the main function to manipulate the pgm files.
		- errorCheck - performs error checks and prints out appropriate error messages when necessary.
		- fileOperations - opens the file for reading and writing, and calls the appropriate functions from pgmOperations.

Task 2:
	Modules needed:
		- pgmComp - runs the functions needed to take two pgm files and check if they are logically identical.
		- errorCheck - performs error checks and prints out appropriate error messages when necessary.
		- fileOperations - opens the file for reading and writing, and calls the appropriate functions from pgmOperations.
		- pgmOperations - contains the functions needed by the main function to manipulate the pgm files.

Task 3:
	Modules needed:
		- pgmOperations - contains the functions needed by the main function to manipulate the pgm files.
		- pgmComp - takes two pgm files and checks if they are logically identical.
		- pgmb2a - takes the binary form of the pgm file and converts it into an ASCII form.
		- pgma2b - takes the ASCII form of the pgm file and converts it into a binary form.
		- errorCheck - performs error checks and prints out appropriate error messages when necessary.
		- fileOperations - opens the file for reading and writing, and calls the appropriate functions from pgmOperations.

Task 4:
	Modules needed:
		- pgmReduce - reduces the size of the input file by a given factor.
		- errorCheck - performs error checks and prints out appropriate error messages when necessary.
		- fileOperations - opens the file for reading and writing, and calls the appropriate functions from pgmOperations.
		- pgmOperations - contains the functions needed by the main function to manipulate the pgm files.

Task 5:
	Modules needed:
		- pgmTile - divides the input file into smaller images with a given dimension.
		- errorCheck - performs error checks and prints out appropriate error messages when necessary.
		- fileOperations - opens the file for reading and writing, and calls the appropriate functions from pgmOperations.
		- pgmOperations - contains the functions needed by the main function to manipulate the pgm files.

Task 6:
	Modules needed:
		- pgmAssemble - creates a larger image from smaller images.
		- errorCheck - performs error checks and prints out appropriate error messages when necessary.
		- fileOperations - opens the file for reading and writing, and calls the appropriate functions from pgmOperations.
		- pgmOperations - contains the functions needed by the main function to manipulate the pgm files.
